# Automated Social Images on Netlify - with Next.js

This project demonstrates the [Resoc image template development kit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/itdk) and
the [Resoc social image Netlify build plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@resoc/netlify-plugin-social-image)

To see the app in action, share https://demo-nextjs-on-netlify.netlify.app/ on a social network or a messaging service and observe the image that illustrates the page: it was generated!

You can recreate the app by [following this tutorial](https://blog.philippebernard.dev/automated-social-images-on-netlify-with-nextjs-and-resoc).
